phpHomeSite - Readme
====================

A very small and fast Web Home Page CMS. It is coded in PHP4 and uses MySQL as
a backend database for data storing. A slick web administration interface allows
the user to manage menu entries, blog, guestbook, images, links and html content
insertion and edit.

Version 0.4 was completely recoded from scratch and the project renamed to phphomesite.
This software was formely known as phphomepage, but it seemed someone else had already
created a script with that name before, so i had to rename it.

Version 0.4.1
